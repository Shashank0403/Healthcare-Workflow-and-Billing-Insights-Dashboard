# üè• Healthcare Operations & Billing Insights Dashboard

A personal data analytics project designed to simulate real-world clinical operations using interactive dashboards. This project visualizes patient data, billing trends, and operational KPIs to explore workflow optimization, improve care coordination, and support data-informed decision-making in healthcare environments.

## üìä Project Highlights

- Visualized data from **10,000 patients** and over **$255.17M** in billing amounts.
- Analyzed average patient length of stay (**15.56 days**) and segmented patients by **age group**, **admission type**, and **test results**.
- Mapped relationships between **medical conditions** and **medications** across six conditions including Hypertension and Diabetes.
- Displayed insurance coverage patterns across providers like **Cigna**, **Aetna**, and **Medicare** with real-time filters and drill-downs.
- Tracked provider billing efficiency and identified abnormal result rates (**34.56%** abnormal tests) to simulate provider performance tracking.

## üí° Purpose

This project was developed as a personal initiative to:

- Understand and simulate clinical operations and workflows.
- Practice building scalable, interactive dashboards with real healthcare-relevant metrics.
- Demonstrate data storytelling, performance analysis, and stakeholder-focused design.
